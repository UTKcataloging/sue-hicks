   <note displayLabel="Transcription">Coral Gables, Florida. April 12, 1940. Personal &amp; Confidential. My dear Judge Hicks-I greatly appreciate your recent letter. there is very little regarding the Scopes case among my father's papers. Mother was greatly opposed to father's activities in assisting in the passage of the anti-evolution laws in several States. I was the only member of our immediate family that encouraged him in his efforts. Being in California I did not have an opportunity to talk with my father &amp; have only his letters to me to rely upon in my present task. Mother did all she could to prevent father from taking part in the Scopes Trial - it was, however, her greatest comfort that her wifely devotion finally had tiumphed over her opinions &amp; she was in Dayton at the time of his death. I am very glad to have your explanation of the position of the prosecution in this case. I have always known father's part in the case was purposefully misinterrupted by the hostile Eastern press, which were his enemies all his public life &amp; by his political foes. Dudley Field Malone's activity in Dayton was undoubt-edly in a spirit of \get even\ because of the severe rebuke father gave him which resulted in his dismissal from the State Department.Father's interest in stopping the spread of the Darwinian Theory was more a matter of states-craft than theology. In other words, his greater concern was the relation &amp; effect on government &amp; the public good of the moral &amp; ethical side of religion than the strictly metaphysical &amp; theological aspect of religion. The development of the Scopes Trial freed him to defend in its entirety ancient Christian dogma, to uphold Christian ethics which is largely the [illegible] of judgement of \what is right &amp; what is wrong,\ in both our civil &amp; criminal law.I would appreciate it if you would send me a copy of The Tennessee Anti-Evolution Act which I assume is still in force. My mother was a good prophet when it came to your future - she told me you would certainly outgrow Dayton &amp; have a distinguished career. My belated congratulations on your judgeship.Sincerely yours,Grace Dexter Bryan. Judge Sue K. Hicks,Madisonville, Tenn.</note>
