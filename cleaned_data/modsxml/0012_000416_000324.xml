   <note displayLabel="Transcription">Pittsburgh July  8thTo Judge John T. Raulston,Mr. H.E. Hicks. Dear Sir: - I am desirous to write to you and the other gentleman participating in Mr. John T. Scope's trial, in regards to belief in Evolution: - and wish to state that, if the human race has originated, or, evolved from either a chimpanzee; gorilla or monkey; - then, if so, wouldn't[2]there be a decided, or discernable change in the general physi  cal features of one, or more Monkeys of their different species. That is, for them to be, or some of them gradually becoming; even (since only two or three hundred years ago), more like a human being. I think this is a very reasonable cause, to justify an opposition to such a definate belief.[3]Again, if the human Race have been evolved from the Monkey, - then we must believe there was one or more black, brown and red Monkeys to cause the differ ent colors of the human Race: - also, a yellow Monkey; don't you think so?Therefore, if evolution of some things is true; then, apparently, I think it very reasonable to disbelieve the theory[4]of the evolution of the Monkey, unless it can be proved. yours Respectfully,Henry Fuller,(Violinist,)N.S. Pittsburgh Pa. P.S. Will state that, after addressing this letter to Judge Raulston, I changed my mind, and addressed it to you. But, if you care to request Judge, J. T. Raulston to read it, you may, of course, decide to do so. P.S. I think, Mr. Hicks, that one fact alone seems to prove that human beings have not desended from the Monkey: - : - which is, in consideration of Feminine facial beauty, and Form; - even so, , to go back far into the time of The (Bible), , (Old Testament.)</note>
