   <note displayLabel="Transcription">1Outline of Speech\nI.Introduction.A. Pride in opportunity [afforded?] by speech.1.Proud to appear before Jury.(a)Body of men with whom I am acquainted personally.(b)men of anglo Saxon Blood,(c) well qualified to decide these issues.\n[stricken: B.]Proud to appear in support of this law.(a) - Happy to be upholding State's laws(1) The legislature is voice of the people of Tennes.(2) [All?] state laws should be upheld by all citizens.(b) - Happy to support a law for the protection of our future citizens.(c) - Happy to be lined up in support of the Bible.(1) we are at a place where there is a direct attempt to discredit the bible.(d) - Happy to assist the [cause?] of science. 2. in fighting dogmatists who try to direct scientific research along the lines of their beliefs and [desires?](1)A large number of scientists have already made up their minds and are trying to get evidence to support their beliefs instead of weighing all evidence open minded.\nB. Seriousness of case.1 - Involves right of legislature to control schools (a) To determine whether teacher can teach his [stricken: desires &amp;amp;] beliefs without restraint in public tax supported schools.(1) may teach any subject he [desires?] if left alone(2) Teach unproven theories.\n[stricken: 2 - Involves right to teach the youth of our country theories unproven]2 - Other states await your decision [&amp;amp;] the decision of the Supreme Courts on this question.(a) They want to control their own teachers.(b) They want to study the affects of teachers teaching evolution.\n3 - unfortunate ridicule case has recieved.(a) The Nature of the subject of legislation [partly?] [come?] of ridicule.\n3(b) Certain elements have used case [stricken: opportunity] as [illegible] in which to advertise themselves.\n](c) Because the subject of evolution [stricken: &amp;amp; the bible] has become a bone of contention among the ministers of the country.(1) Bishop Brown's expulsion etc.(2) [Been Brewing?] for years.\n(d) Reference to the bible always excites interest of everybody and in[v?]ites criticism from the enemies of the bible. C. -\n4II Body -A - Issues Involved 1. Constitutional questions Raised.a. not within the [providence?] of Jury to decide.\n2. - Does evidence show Scopes guilty of violating this Act? (a) Taught man originated in the sea with the one celled animals [&amp;amp;] developed to what he is today.\n[stricken: 3.] (b) conflicts with bible story of creation.(1) Bible says that each species was intended to reproduce \after its kind.\ Gen. 1st chapter verses 11, 12, 21, 24 [&amp;amp;] 25.(2) Bible says that man was created in his own image. On [stricken: verse?] Gen 1:26 we \n5read \And God said, let us make Man in our image, after our likeness.\ In the Hebrew language the verb translated \make\ its _ ([The?] Bible Brief).\n(3) Not necessary for you to determine how the bible should be interpreted for the legislature [examined?] its power [&amp;amp;] [expressed?] its meaning when it said \And instead that Man descended from a [lower] order of animals.\\n(c) Taught Darwin's theory [&amp;amp;] De [Vries?]' theory [from?] the Biology [text?] book Pages 164-165 252, 253, 254 [&amp;amp;] 255.\n6III ConclusionA - Why you should convict Scopes.\n1. Because violated law of state(a) It is your duty to uphold state laws.(1) you are sworn to uphold the law.\n(b) you should be all the more stronger for upholding the laws of the state for there is an inclination by certain people to only obey the laws that they like and disobey the ones that they do not like.(1) look at Murray Butler.(2) Look at Roger Baldwin.\n72 - Because Scopes is  [undermining?] the morals of our children by teaching them a doctrine that [teaches/] every thin [belief?] in an established religion and gives them nothing in return.\n83 - Because Theories of evolution are unproven and are not reasonably substantiated by the very evidence on which they are based.(a) no way to tell whether or not the argument of monkeys and man shows a cronological development. It is just as reasonable to say that man appeared first and that the monkeys developed after and from [him?].(b)\n94 Evolution has become a religious controversy and for this reason alone should not be taught in our public Schools.(a) Ministers of the church have been in disagreement for sometime.(b) Pennsylvania and other States have passed laws against reading [&amp;amp;] teaching the Bible in School, why not also eliminate anti bible doctrine such as evolution?</note>
