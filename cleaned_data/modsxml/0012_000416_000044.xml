   <note displayLabel="Transcription">Biology W.H. Robinson\nExperiment #I1. Oxygen and its Properties.2. Object of Experiment - to make and determine the properties of Oxygen3. Process [note: includes drawing with labels A, B, C, D, E, written word \HEAT\]KCLOå_ (in a test tube with a little MNO? (A) fitted with a stopper with one hole. (B) the stopper (C) the delivery tube and let it go in the [waller?] (as D)4. Heat the test tube &amp;amp; catch the gass that escapes in Bottle (E) by means of display [illegible]Test activity of oxygen with Phosphorus, wood splinters, &amp;amp; sulpher KCLO? + MNO? \heat\ 2 KCL + 2 O? = O{x}ygen C + O? = CO? = carbondioxideMG + O? = 2MGO Magnesium Dioxide S + O? = SO? Sulpher Dioxide4P + 5O? = 2P?O? Phosphorous Pentexide5. Result; Oxygen is very active element in the air and suports combustion\nExperiment II1. Properties of Hydrogen2. Object: to prove that water is formed by Oxidation of Hitrogen3. Process [note: includes diagram of test tube with labels A, B, written word \zinc\]Put zinc metal in Bottle (A) and Poar sulphurec-acid through the thislle tube (B) and there will be a gass given off due to action [stricken: of sulphuric acid, hydrogen] on zinc replacing the hydrogen in the acid, hydrogen being given of as a gass, ignite hydrogen and it will burn into Oxygen producing a moisture.\nExperiment #31. Carbon and Carbondioxide2. Object of this experiment is carbon, Carbondioxide, and its Properties3. Procedure [note: includes drawing]Take some ordinary d put in a test tube, and fit a delivery tube in a one hole stopper in test tube and [aluminating?] gas will be given off leaving charcoal in the test tube, this is pure carbon. Burn the carbon and the gass passing through lime water makes it milkey Proving that the carbon is carbon dioxide gas The [stricken: carbon] charcoal is pure Carbon\nExperiment #41. What Oxygen matter contains2. Object: to determine wheather there is any mineral matter in oxygen matter3. Procedure: Burn                 part will burn and part will not same with Irish Potatoes. In both cases will be a substance left called [Gnash?]. Take a piece of potato way it and heat gently with out scourching or burning. After it is heated a while it will lose wate4. conclusion the ash that has been left in both cases will be known as mineral matter and [is?] loss of wate during heating\nthere fore the                matter will contain mineral and moisture\nExperiment no=5=[note: experiment includes hand-drawn table of breakfast foods and distribution by calories, \Protine\, \Fat\, \carbondioxide\.]\nExperiment no 6=\n[note: pencil drawing of cross-section of a tree, labeled as follows in blue ink]{Bark}{Pith}{Pith [rays?] running from the [center?] to the [outside?]} [note: ink stains over words]{Rings to tell how old the tree is}\nExperiment no 7=A flower cut lengthwise[note: drawing of a flower, labeled as follows]PistilPollenPetalsStamensOvery containing seedsStemThe green leaf like Parts that inclose the bud of a flower is called SepalsThe more bright colored structure is the Petals. The cup of the flour is where the necter is made.\nExperiment no 8=[note: includes drawing]If you plant some beans so you can watch them grow you well first notice the Hy poctyl comes out first then turns down to make the roots and as it grows the bean is raised out of the ground When it is about 3/4 in. above the ground the bean devides and makes the first beanes.\nExperiment no. 91. % of Oxygen in the air2. To determine the % of oxygen in air3. [note: drawing of experiment, labeled as follows]WaterPhosphorusFloat a piece of phosphorus on a card-board on water, after igniting the phosphorus turn a graduate over it.The phosphorus will burn until all of the oxygen is used up, then water will replace the space occupied by oxygen4. The higth of the graduate was 7 in and and water replaced about 3? in.\nExperimemt no. 101. Put corn starch and iodine solution in test tube. Crush the starch and add ? tube of water to a bit of starch about the size of a pea then add 5 drops of iodine solution.2. result - the solution changed to a dark blue\nExperiment no 11=I The capacity of the lungs. Fill a 2 gall. jug with water and turn it up-side-down in a pan of water then blow your breath in the jug and the air will push the water out. I blew out about 2 gall.\nII(A) Burn organtic matter and catch the smoke in a jar then pore lime water in the jar and shake it, the lime water will turn milkey on the account of carbon-dioxide. (B) Then put lime water in some-thing and blow your breath through it it will turn milkey this is a proof that the lungs give off carbondioxide\nExperiment no=12=Place a å_ cake of yeast in each of the following and also sugar or [slauch?] [note: drawing of three bottles, labeled A, B, C.] Then place A in a cold dark place, B in a warm dark place, C in a warm light place you will find the yeast germs to grow very fast in the warm dark place, &amp;amp; in the warm light place they grow nearly as well, but in the cold Dark place the yeast will not grow.It is best for the development of yeast in a warm dark placeExperiment no 1 3=In Examining an English Sparrow you find the bill has [two?] parts the upper and lower which is to gather food.There feet is [are?] for locomotion on dry ground and for purchingThere feathers are for protection from cold and Etc.There wings are for flight and the tail feathers for a guide.These birds live on insects and a very small % of grain they ead a great deal of weed seadsThey build nests in parts of old houses and around the barns and in burd houses</note>
