   <note displayLabel="Transcription">[marginal note: 6 pp]Evolution: What Is It Not?(From the standpoint of Holy Scripture)By S.A. White\nI submit, what all evangelical Bible Students and teachers the world over, believe to be the very words of God, by \holy men of God, who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost\ (II Pet. I: 20, 21).Evolution, from one \kind\ of creature to any other \kind\, is not only impossible in Nature; but is contrary to t ?]] which God Himself [illegible] and promulgated.If any man thinks otherwise, let him try to \evolve\ by any means in his power another \kind\ from a different \kind\: of course he knows this is humanly impossible; but he thinks, and persuades himself to believe, that the \Supreme Being\ - whoever He is - for they do not know Him, being agnostic, started nature on a course of evoluting entirely by its own powers apart from any known, or dis-covered laws which make this evoluting possible. Then why speculate upon the unknown, and teach a \doctrine\ as though it were \the truth\2based on absolute agnostic ignorance?\We know\ that the Creator does not, and morally cannot, cross one \kind\ with any other \kind\ in order to evolve a new sort of a creation. The CREATOR CREATES. He does not need to evolve.He does not cross-breed; and all attempts at producing a mongrel type of human beings, by human beings, or demons, He absolutely forbids; and has \destroyed\ all such evidences; and will destroy them as often as men or demons succeed in producing them!A giant type of half man and half demon under the leadership of \Beelzebub\, was pro-duced by cross-breeding (Gen VI: 4) - \I will destroy them with the earth,\ God said (v. 13) - and He did: \and destroyed them all,\ said the Son of God Himself (Luke XVII: 26, 27).As to all animal life, save such as were saved in the Ark, male and female of every \kind\ He wished to preserve alive for future propagation of its own pure blooded \kind\ - they too were all \destroyed with the earth\ (Gen. VII: 2, 3).Fossil remains, thrown up from the deep by cataclysmic upheavals; or, by mighty submerg-3ences, deposited with the various stratas of the earth do not, and cannot prove any theory of evolution (ch. VII: 11).Evidences are abundant everywhere of this great geological cataclysm - and there are greater ones to come!Social, political, religious, geographical are in process, even now; even this earth itself is now preparing for some [stricken: great] gigantic read-justments, closing finally - when we are not informed as to the calendar times - by a \might\ consuming fire, when the present - \the heavens and the earth which are now\, will be absolutely blasted out of existence (II Pet. III: 7-12); and will be replaced by an eternal, non-destructible \new heavens and a new earth\ (v. 13).One of the strongest theories, based upon supposed evidences of fossil remains, that the horse was evolved from an animal of a lower order, but similar in shape to the present noble looking animal, has been photographed and exhibited to gullible would-be \scientists\ as proofs of evolution.4But please notice, that IF such a process passed through innumerable ages, and evolved itself by some inherent evoluting \law\, that even this would not be \evolution\ from one \kind\ to another different \kind\.For IF our present noble animal \improved\ itself over and over again, it would be development, not evolution!It does not prove the theory to be even well grounded.Besides, there is absolutely no such thing as self-improvement either in the vegetable or animal life of the non-human \kind\.The law of existence is in the [reverse?] way - it deteriorates until lost out, as can be proven by our present vegetable life, if left to itself.When conditions in nature change, so that life according to them changed conditions, cannot be sustained, it dies off, of which there is also abundant proof - it does not change itself into another \kind\ in order to meet the changed conditions: produce proofs to the contrary - they cannot be found.5If any \kind\ of life is needed to meet the requirements of any age, they are \CREATED\ to meet them (Isaiah XLVIII:7):\They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them\.\The Missing Link\Fossil remains have shown a near-human - near-best type of life - but why \fossil\? does it not prove rather that God \destroyed\ such \abominations\ from the face of the earth? They do not prove evolution, but they do prove the human attempt at cross-breeding the human and the beast!The Bible tells us in terms plainly to be understood, [stricken: that?] that the human did cohabit with the beast; but God would not suffer their progeny to live, to be a [illegible] of \His offspring\ - let scientists beware! (Lev. XX: 18-23. [Note: the Bible passage cited here does not appear to be the correct reference.]We are also informed in Romans I:21-326that human beings descended even to a lower moral state and condition than God can ever permit to abide before him.\And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient\ (v. 28).\Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools\ (22).They wanted to be \agnostic\; and of all such \wise\ people, it will again be said \they became fools\; and -\Their folly shall be manifest unto all men\ (II Tim. III:9).S.A.W.</note>
