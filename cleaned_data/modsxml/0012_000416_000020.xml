   <note displayLabel="Transcription">1. Mendel's Law of Heredity disproves Evolution.\n\n2. If the rocks show the evidence of evolution why do they not also contain a complete chain? Why the missing links?\n3. Evolution not modern theory. originated in Greece by Alexander [&amp;] [Thales?] six centuries before Christ. They Held all things come from water. (Here cope pages 3 "the [Last?] word on Evolution" between [illegible])\n4 Nietzche's "Survival of the Fittest" in Germany and what it did for Germany.\n5 - [Apeman?] or Pithecanthropus a forgery. Pages 14 [&amp;] 15 "Last word in Evolution". Pilldown Man\n6 - Can't teach Bible in [our?] Schools [Why] teach Evolution.\n6 Survival of Fittest, or natural selection carried to extreme means that we do no good by saving the weak or by vaccination etc.\n7 The jury is not to [stricken: judge] pass upon the wisdom of the law, that has been done by the legislature. It is your duty to enforce the law.\n8 - If man did not evolve from the [lower?] animals but came up from the primate stock as the defense claims, then there is no evidence whatever in the rocks of man's evolution.\n9 - [Ashley?] Fossil [Ruls?] in L.C. 100 miles in diameter [&amp;] 10 ft deep. Has been mined for fertilizer [since?] 1844. No evidence of evolution [ever?] found there.</note>
