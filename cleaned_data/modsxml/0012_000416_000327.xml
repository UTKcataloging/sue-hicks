   <note displayLabel="Transcription">New YorkJuly 3, 1925. S.K. Hicks,Attorney,Dayton, Tenn. My dear Mr. Hicks:No doubt you, as me, have become cognizant of the \boring in process\ of Communists in America, working in church, in school, in labor organizations under the cover of some appealing name for the suppression of religion, the desecration of family life, the confiscation of property and the overthrow of our government as their ultimate goal.The Civil Liberties Union is classed with the above, which gives a source for concern when we are informed that the Scopes trial or defense is to be financed by them.I will quote from \The New York Commercial\ and from R.M. Whitney (now deceased) author of a pamphlet from the Beckwith Press.\The American Civil Liberties Union takes the position that laws purporting to prevent the advocacy of the \overthrow of the government by force and violence\ are not violations of the right of free speech, that the expression of all opinions, however obnoxious should be tolerated.\xx \The American Civil Liberties Union opposes any attempt to prevent teachers in the [2] public schools and colleges teaching communism or any other destructive doctrine.\New York Commercial\The Trade Union Educational League pronounces an in-junction a cancer eating at the heart of the labor movement. They say \lickspittle\ judges today are legion. They affirm judges are \lackleys.\ They belittle the courts of the nation. xxxIt seems most unfortunate that the revolutionaries of these militant organizations are counting on the people's revolution, as they call it, to prepare the way to usher in the period which \will produce the Communist Mass Party.\ It is equally to be deplored that or-ganizations of men and women under the Civil Liberties dominion are working along parallel lines with the Trade Union Educational League.Something of the scope of the work carried on by the American Civil Liberties Union will be realized when it is known that about 800 lawyers are associated with the work. Some 11 correspondents, both state and local, are circularized regularly for in-formation and receive most of the Union's publi-cations. An extensive clipping service brings the news of every case of any importance and immediate telegrams or letters are sent out offering help in every instance. The Union proceeds on the theory \ours is a definite piece of general propaganda and first aid.\ Whitney's pamphlet.Wishing you all success and complete victory -</note>
