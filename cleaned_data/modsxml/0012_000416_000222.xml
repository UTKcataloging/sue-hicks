   <note displayLabel="Transcription">June 1, 1925. Hon. S.K. Hicks,Dayton, Tennessee.Dear Sir: I am sending you under separate cover, a Copy of the Park City Daily News. of Bowling Green, with an article which I wrote some time ago on "Bryan &amp; Darwin". Also a paper from Mt. Vernon, Mo., with a paragraph on Clarence Darrow. He is an old infidel, &amp; has defended scoundrels &amp; rakes of Chicago, until he has no more conscience than a mollusk &amp; considers all mankind on a common level. I hope you will let him know that he is not in the slums of Chicago, when he is in the pure air of Tennessee.[2]You have nothing to fear at his hands. In the paper I am sending you, I give the Bible origin of "species" which I hope may be of service to you. I am a Tennessean myself, &amp; am sorry that I cannot hope to hear the trial. With all good wishes, I am,Sincerely yours,J.M. Carter.</note>
