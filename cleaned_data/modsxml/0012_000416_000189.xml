   <note displayLabel="Transcription">Prosecutor,Grand Jury,Dayton, Tenn.\nMy dear Sir: Allow me to enter the debate on \Evolution\, with the following \five points.\No. 1. To teach this falsity of eminently erroneous theorising is harmful and vicious, and destructive of freedom, because it has absolutely no foundation, scientific or otherwise, upon which 2.to build logical facts.The first men, be-cause nearest to the likeness and image of God, could not have been monkeys. When man fell away from this high state of likeness to God, he degenerated into loving self more than God and the neighbor.Man was not, on the very face of truth and common sense, born to tear his neighbor with his teeth, nor to destroy the like-ness and image of3God, into which he was created.This would be going against Divine law and order - \flying in the face of Providence\.\nNo. 2. As far back as can be traced, man was always man, horse was horse, ape was ape, trees were trees, Etc; all according to the inherent laws of Divine creation, propagation, and pre-servation. The only evolution was from 4.seed to fruition.\nNo. 3. To teach that morphine-taking is good for soul and body is wrong, as we all know, and to permit such teaching would ultimately destroy the human race, destroy freedom, and make a mockery of law and order. True freedom can only be obtained through the enactment of just laws.The State law of Tennessee, prohibiting the teaching of the [5.]theory of evolution, protects the people of that State from the poisons of false theorising that would drug and warp the mind, and thence the body, just as morphine-taking would destroy the body and corrupt morals. We are free to take them both, but we must be taught that the effects are evil.\nNo. 4. Common sense dictates that false theorising, in opposition[6.]to proper interpretation of Biblical allegory, and historical facts, would lead to atheism, paganism, and mental slavery. Those who reason against the Word of God are slaves to the enticements of self-love. True freedom can only come by strictly adhering to the great truths of the Word of God, and regulating our lives thereby.\nNo. 5. The freedom of teaching is not involved[7.]in this anti-Evolution law, but freedom is promoted by thus en-acting and enforcing laws for the welfare of humanity, against the attempts of those who would reduce humanity to the monkey-ism of inhumanity.Sincerely yours,William Ross.\n2261 Andrews Ave.Bronx, N.Y. City.\nMay 15, 1925.</note>
